            <h2>What Am I Doing?</h2>
            <p>
              I'm doing this. What is this? Well, this paragraph is a HTML node. That might sound peculiar, but anyone could learn the basic syntax in a scant 10 minutes if they so cared. HTML isn't even considered a programing language. 
              What is it considered? I don't know. Something else. Let's look it up. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics" target="_blank">
              According to the good people at MDN</a>, it's a "markup language." I guess if I had taken the time to say HyperText Markup Language in my head, I could have deduced that 
              without the Google assist. Damn. Anyway, HTML is not a programming language because it's not intelligent enough to write out serious computer logic. It's used for web-layout.              
            </p> 
            <p> 
              So that's cool, but it doesn't really look cool until you link the HTML to a CSS file. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is what styles the HTML. CSS is also not a 
              programming language. We're talking about stuff like font, color, line-spacing, etc. There is much more to CSS, but we don't need to get into the weeds on this. The point is, I 
              learned this stuff.
            </p> 
            <p> 
              But what about the actual programming languages?

            <h2>The Real McCoys</h2>
            <p>
              The two actual real-deal programming languages I've been learning are Python and Javascript. Python is more compact and can be used to do just about anything. The big project I did 
              with Python was to create a webscraper that automatically looks up the duration of films (via rottentomatoes.com) that I have typed in a spreadsheet and populates the adjacent spreadsheet column 
              with that value. It also takes into account things like misspellings in my entries or multiple films that have the same title and will ask clarifying questions to the user. So if I 
              wrote siera madre in my spreadsheet, when the script runs, it will ask me, “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, the 1948 film staring Humphrey Bogart?(y/n).” Then I can affirm that 
              that is the film I ment to write. Conversely, if that isn't the film I intended, I can reply no, and the program will spit out other matched film titles.
            </p> 
            <p> 
              The code is pretty complex and otherworldly looking to the uninitiated. It looks like <a href="https://github.com/y2j964/filmDurationLookUp/blob/master/dvr.py" target="_blank">this</a>.
            </p> 
            <p> 
              Javascript is, quite frankly, a cow. It's hideous. Semi-colons abound! And yet it's used on every website on the internet. So it's quite useful. It's the dynamic part of a webpage, 
              enabling users to interact with the content. When you looking at a product on a ecommerce website and you click the button that says, "Add to cart", Javascript is what actually moves 
              that item into your cart. You set up an event listener that listens for the user to click the button, and when they do, the button triggers a function to do the work that you need it to do.

              The following primitive example of Javascript. Pick a song subject, drop a coin in the jukebox, and marvel at the wonder of Javascript.

            <h3>What Am I Doing As I Write This Blather?</h3>
              <p>I am listening to arguably the most important rock band in American history. I'm speaking of course of the Beach Boys. Specifically, we're listening to Summer Days (And 
              Summer Nights!!). That's the one with this boss cover:

              There is a song on here called "Salt Lake City." Apparently, Brian and the Boys think Salt Lake is as groovy and out of sight as I do. They even go 
              so far to say that "girl for girl, they've got the cutest of the Western states." But then a few songs later, they're going on about how they wish they all could be California 
              girls. So I'm not really sure what to make of that inconsistency. Whatever the case, Salt Lake City, we'll be coming soon.

                This site is brought to you by Fender guitars and surfing. It's a genuine fact that both of these things rule.
